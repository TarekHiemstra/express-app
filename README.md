## DevOps with Docker course exercise 3.1
For the [DevOps with Docker course exercise 3.1](https://github.com/TarekHiemstra/devopswithdocker/tree/main/part3/exercise3.1) it is required to create a new repo for this small application. The files have been copied from [docker-hy github](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/express-app) to my own repo.
